# nuxeo-mongodb-apb

This [Ansible Playbook Bundle](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle) provisions and de-provisions a MongoDB replica set with or without security. This APB is based on the the stable [MongoDB Replicaset Helm Chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mongodb-replicaset) and inherits its pre-requisites and caveats.
